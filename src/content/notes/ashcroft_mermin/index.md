description: Notes on Aschroft & Mermin's SSP.

Hey! These are some notes I've compiled as I read through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_and_Mermin">Ashcroft & Mermin's Solid State Physics</a> during summer 2025.

I wrote some simulations/code snippets in Julia, which are embedded on the site itself. Hopefully, this means that you can vary parameters, explore some visuals, yada yada. This style (inspired from MAT_SCI201 @ Northwestern) was mainly to keep me incentivized to take good notes and exercise my programming skills.
