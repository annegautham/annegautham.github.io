description: Overview of solid-state physics notes.
---

Hey! These are some notes I've compiled as I read through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_and_Mermin">Ashcroft & Mermin's Solid State Physics</a> during summer 2025. They are somewhat organized by chapter.

I wrote some simulations/code snippets in Julia, which are embedded on the site itself. Hopefully, this means that you can vary parameters, explore some visuals, yada yada. This style was mainly to keep me incentivized to take good notes and exercise my programming skills. Also, many have said that the best way to truly verify if you understand concepts is to explain it well to others, so here's my feeble attempt.

Please don't come after me.
