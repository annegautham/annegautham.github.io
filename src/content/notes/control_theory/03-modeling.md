# System Modeling

_Note: This is a placeholder file for control theory modeling notes._

## Introduction

In control theory, system modeling is the process of developing mathematical models that describe the behavior of dynamical systems.

## Types of Models

- **Linear vs. Nonlinear Models**
- **Time-invariant vs. Time-varying Models**
- **Continuous-time vs. Discrete-time Models**

## State-Space Representation

The state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output, and state variables related by first-order differential equations.
