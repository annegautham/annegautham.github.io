## What is Control Theory?

Control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems with inputs. The objective is to develop a model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot.

## Historical Background

- Early mechanical governors
- Development of mathematical foundations
- Modern control theory

## Applications

- Robotics
- Aerospace systems
- Process control
- Automotive systems
- Economic systems
