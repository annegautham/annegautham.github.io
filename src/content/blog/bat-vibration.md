description: My ME363 (Vibrations) final project! Vibrational analysis of baseball bats.
---

Have you ever wondered why a baseball bat stings your hands when you mishit a ball ‚Äî or why some hits feel effortlessly powerful? Behind those sensations lie the hidden vibrations of the bat, shaped by its geometry, material, and how you grip it. This article is a recap of my final project for my ME363 (Mechanical Vibrations) class at Northwestern. My partners were Tianhao Zhang and Thomas Hoang.

## Introduction

We investigate the mechanical vibrations of wooden and aluminum baseball bats to better understand the physical phenomena behind the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù and the sting players often feel when the ball is hit off-center. These effects are tied to the bat‚Äôs bending vibrations, which influence both energy transfer and user comfort.

By modeling the bat as a series of Euler-Bernoulli beam elements and analyzing its bending modes using finite element and modal analysis in MATLAB, we aim to estimate the bending stiffness EI that best matches experimentally measured natural frequencies. The bat‚Äôs geometry is simplified into interconnected beam elements, each with translational and rotational degrees of freedom, which allows for the assembly of global mass and stiffness matrices. Solving the resulting eigenvalue problem provides insight into the bat‚Äôs vibrational behavior and enables non-destructive estimation of material properties. The most appropriate value of EI is determined by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the computed and experimental frequencies, as well as convergence testing on the number of elements.

This approach connects the physical experience of swinging a bat with engineering analysis and demonstrates how vibration modeling applies to real-world systems. This project highlights the broader relevance of vibration analysis in sports engineering, where performance, comfort, and design optimization all depend on a deep understanding of dynamic behavior.

## Modeling

### Physical Model

In this project, the baseball bat is modeled as a one-dimensional structure that primarily undergoes transverse bending vibrations. The bat has multiple sections including the knob, grip, taper, and barrel. Each section of the bat is approximated as a beam composed of multiple straight segments, each with a varying moment of inertia and varying diameter, especially in the taper section to capture its shape.

![element-wise model](@assets/images/bat-vibration/element-model.png)

Each bat is discretized into N straight Euler-Bernoulli beam elements. The finite element model is built by assigning three degrees of freedom per node: axial displacement ùë¢, vertical displacement ùë£, and rotational displacement (slope) ùúô. Each element is connected to two nodes, and is thus governed by a 6√ó6 mass matrix and a 6√ó6 stiffness matrix in local coordinates, capturing the bending behavior between its two end nodes.

### Mathematical Model

The governing equation for free vibration in finite element form is:

$$
\left[ M^G \right] \ddot{D} + \left[ K^G \right] D = \{ f(t) \}
$$

where

- $\left[ M^G \right]$ is the global mass matrix,
- $\left[ K^G \right] $ is the global stiffness matrix,
- $D$ is the global displacement vector, $D^{''}$ is its second partial derivative with respect to time. The global displacement vector contains the axial displacements $u_n$, the transverse displacements $v_n$, and the slopes $\phi_n$ (which is equal to $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ at node $n$).

Solving this second-order differential equation involves transforming it into a generalized eigenvalue problem, which can be solved using MATLAB's `eig` function. The eigenvalues are the natural frequencies squared, and the eigenfunctions show the mode shapes. Some solutions that correspond to rigid body motion (zero-frequency modes) are filtered out after the eigenvalue analysis.

The main challenge is to construct the stiffness matrix $[K]$ and the mass matrix $[M]$. We can find these matrices using the energy method. In order to find the potential energy (strain energy) V and kinetic energy T in the beam segments, we must integrate with respect to the x coordinate. Since we are using a finite element method and we only know the displacements at the nodes accurately, we have to interpolate along the x axis in each segment.

After we obtain the interpolation functions for each segment, we can calculate the strain energy and kinetic energy in the segment. We find the strain energy $V_n$ to be a quadratic form of the displacement vector $\mathbf{d}_n$, and the kinetic energy $T_n$ to be a quadratic form of the time derivative of the displacement vector. Therefore, we can express both in a symmetric matrix product form, where all coefficients are contained in symmetric matrices.

Specifically, we have:

$$
V_n = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{d}_n^\top [K]_n \mathbf{d}_n
\quad \text{and} \quad
T_n = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{d}_n}{\partial t} \right)^\top [M]_n \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{d}_n}{\partial t} \right)
$$

The matrices $[K]_n$ and $[M]_n$ are computed using the `ElementMassAndStiffness.m` script.

Now that we have the stiffness and mass matrices for each element, we can combine them into global stiffness and mass matrices, denoted as $[K]^G$ and $[M]^G$. Using the fact that the global (total) strain energy and kinetic energy are the sum of the local (element-level) strain energy and kinetic energy, and that the local displacement vector $\mathbf{d}_n$ can be extracted from the global displacement vector $\mathbf{D}$ using a connectivity matrix $Q_n$ (i.e., $\mathbf{d}_n = Q_n \cdot \mathbf{D}$), we can derive the relationship between the global and local stiffness and mass matrices.

Specifically, we have:

$$
[K]^G = \sum_n [K]^G_n = \sum_n Q_n^\top [K]_n Q_n
\quad \text{and} \quad
[M]^G = \sum_n [M]^G_n = \sum_n Q_n^\top [M]_n Q_n
$$

At this point, we can finally construct the governing equation for the system and solve the resulting eigenvalue problem.

### Material and Geometry Input

The project uses two different baseball bats. One of the bats, a wooden bat, is solid, while the second bat, an aluminum bat, is hollow. Below are their geometrical properties, including their density calculations:

![property table](@assets/images/bat-vibration/property-table.png)

### Target Frequencies (Measured)

As part of this lab, we experimentally collected vibration data by clamping each baseball bat to a laboratory counter, simulating a cantilever beam configuration where the handle end was fixed and the barrel end was free to move. To excite the bat, we gently struck the free end with a small mallet, once at the front end and once at the rear end. The resulting motion was captured using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) focused on the tip of the bat. It uses laser interferometry to measure the velocity of the vibrating surface as a function of time. The velocity-time data was then processed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract the dominant frequency. Peaks in the frequency spectrum correspond to the bat‚Äôs natural frequencies, with the first and second bending modes being of primary interest.

Furthermore, we struck the wooden bat from two directions: from the top and the side. Wood is an anisotropic material‚Äì its mechanical properties vary depending on the fiber direction. Striking the bat in different orientations allowed us to observe how directional stiffness influences vibrational behavior, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the wooden bat‚Äôs dynamic response.

Below are the FFT responses of the various experimental measurements we took. For the aluminum bat, we noticed that there is a noise peak at 54 Hz, which we disregarded. We found the first mode peak to be 20.46 Hz, and the second mode peak to be 295.215 Hz. For the wooden bat hit vertically, we note that both the horizontal and vertical modes are present, but at different amplitudes. Since 16.01 Hz is present at a greater amplitude, we determine this to be indicative of the vertical first mode. In addition, we find the second mode peak to be at 222.412 Hz. Finally, for the wooden bat struck horizontally, we once again note the presence of both vertical and horizontal first modes. We choose 15.2344 Hz to be indicative of the horizontal first mode peak, and 223.73 Hz to be the horizontal second mode peak, which is consistent with the vertical mode peak selections.

![measured fft](@assets/images/bat-vibration/fft-measured.png)

These results are summarized below in the table below:
![measured frequencies](@assets/images/bat-vibration/freq-table.png)

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that, for each of the experiment setups, the mode frequencies we got from hitting the front end and hitting the rear end were very close in value. The numbers in the above table show the average of those two frequencies.

### Boundary Conditions

The bat is modeled as being fixed at the handle, simulating the clamp, while the barrel end is free. This fixed-free configuration corresponds to a cantilever beam, which reflects the typical constraint conditions during a swing. While there would be damping in real life, damping is not included in the model, as only free natural frequencies and mode shapes are of interest in this modal analysis.

### Matlab Implementation

The full MATLAB code will be included in the appendix. This section will summarize the approach we used in MATLAB to achieve the results. The code consists of two main scripts:

- `ElementMassAndStiffness.m`: The context and derivation of this script was explained in Section 2.2 Mathematical Model. This script calculates the local element mass and stiffness matrices based on the provided bending stiffness EI, material density œÅ, cross-sectional area A, and element length L. This script was provided to us.
- `BaseballBatModes.m`: This is the main driver script. It.
  1. Divides the baseball bats into N elements (multiply N by two if error is greater than tolerance to find satisfactory N)
  2. Loops over a range of Young‚Äôs Modulus, E
  3. Computes the geometric and material data for each element.
  4. Calls `ElementMassAndStiffness.m` to compute element matrices.
  5. Assembles the global mass and stiffness matrices.
  6. Applies appropriate boundary conditions (i.e., fixed at the handle).
  7. Solves the eigenvalue problem using eig.
  8. Sorts and filters the physical vibration modes.
  9. Calculate the percent errors of both the first and second vibrational modes
  10. Perfectly matches the first mode frequency by selecting an E value, and then calculates the error of the second mode frequency.
  11. Visualize the percent error of first vibration mode over the range of E
  12. Visualizes the first two mode shapes of Young‚Äôs Modulus E that minimize error.

### Results

#### Aluminum

##### Convergence Test

Using a Young‚Äôs Modulus of 70 GPa for aluminum (our initial guess), we modify the number of elements divided in each section of the baseball bat for convergence testing. The result is summarized in the table below:

![aluminum bat convergence](@assets/images/bat-vibration/aluminum-conv.png)

The element distribution of 10/20/10 and 20/40/20 saw very minor changes between their frequency values. Thus, we decided to use a total of 40 elements in our stiffness estimate for the aluminum bat‚Äì 10 for the grip, 20 for the taper, and 10 for the barrel, for a balance between accuracy and minimizing computing power.

##### Stiffness Estimate

The following plot was constructed using MATLAB, showing the percent error of the first mode frequency over the range of E, as well as the error of the first two mode frequencies:

##### Convergence Test

Using a Young‚Äôs Modulus of 12 GPa for wood (our initial guess), we modify the number of elements divided in each section of the baseball bat for convergence testing. The result is summarized in the table below:

![wooden bat convergence](@assets/images/bat-vibration/wood-conv.png)

The element distribution of 10/20/10 and 20/40/20 saw minimal changes between their frequency values. Thus, we also decided to use a total of 40 elements in our stiffness estimate for the wooden bat‚Äì 10 for the grip, 20 for the taper, and 10 for the barrel, for a balance between accuracy and minimizing computing power.

## Discussion

### Accuracy of Result

The Young‚Äôs Modulus of wood ranges from 10 to 60 GPa, depending on the axis measured along and the type of wood. Our predicted Young‚Äôs Modulus of the bat of 22.92 and 20 GPa for vertical and horizontal axes falls comfortably in the 10-60 range. In addition, we found the Young‚Äôs Modulus of the aluminum bat to be ~50 GPa, which is well under the 69 GPa textbook metric. However, this is expected, since the bat is likely composed of an aluminum composite, which may be less stiff than a bat made of pure aluminum.

### Anisotropic Properties of Wood

Wood is an anisotropic material, meaning its mechanical properties vary along 3 mutually orthogonal axes (longitudinal, radial, and tangential). In this project, we simplified the bat as having two orthogonal stiffness directions, represented by our vertical striking vs. horizontal striking a wooden bat. This anisotropy strongly influences vibration behavior. The Young‚Äôs Modulus along the grain (vertical) is larger than that across the grain (horizontal).

### Convergence Testing

The convergence test showed that increasing the number of beam elements leads to more accurate results up to a certain point. Models with too few elements underrepresented the curvature of the mode shapes and produced inaccurate frequency estimates. Once the number of elements was sufficiently high, the natural frequencies converged to stable values, confirming the reliability of the discretization. This convergence behavior also helped us confirm that the remaining discrepancy between experimental and modeled frequencies was not due to resolution error but to other sources, which will be discussed below.

### Frequency ratios and boundary conditions

In our finite element model, we assumed a perfectly fixed support at the handle, which simplified the model and allowed us to analyze the problem. However, in the experimental setup, the bat was clamped to the lab table and did not provide a truly rigid constraint. One way to detect this discrepancy is through the frequency ratio. When the geometry of a beam is fixed and its density and Young‚Äôs modulus are uniform everywhere, this ratio becomes an indicator of boundary condition type, since it depends only on how the beam is constrained. Our FEM models consistently predict higher ratios between 2nd and 1st mode frequencies as compared to the experimental data. This suggests that the actual support condition in the experiment is not perfectly fixed but likely behaves more like a partially restrained system. The extra compliance softens the system and alters the distribution of vibrational energy between modes, especially the lower ones. This emphasizes the importance of boundary conditions in dynamic modeling and suggests our simulation could be improved by incorporating more realistic support behavior.

### Minimization of First Mode Error

Due to this limitation introduced by our simplified boundary condition model, we placed greater emphasis on matching the first natural frequency when estimating the bending stiffness EI. The lower mode is less sensitive to boundary conditions and exhibits larger amplitudes.. In contrast, higher modes tend to be more influenced by small variations in support stiffness and are harder to capture precisely due to a lower signal-to-noise ratio. While minimizing the mean squared error between the first and second mode frequencies provides a balanced fit in theory, it can overweight inaccuracies in higher modes caused by boundary condition mismatch. As a result, we chose to estimate EI by minimizing the error in the first mode frequency alone, under the assumption that this mode represents the true dynamic behavior of the bat in our experiment better.

### Other possible error sources

Several additional sources of error may have contributed to discrepancies between the simulated and experimental results:

- The Euler-Bernoulli beam model, which assumes that cross-section planes remain planes after bending and is used in the calculation of strain energy, does not apply well to wide and short beams. Timoshenko Beam theory may serve as a better model in this instance.
- The polynomial interpolation within each beam segment does not accurately represent deformation behavior.
- The discretization of the bat‚Äôs taper part does not accurately represent physical reality.
- The base plate in the barrel part was neglected in the model.
- Our experiment pointed the LDV at a slight angle on the bat, which may have introduced coupling with axial modes of the bats.
- In addition, our model is a simplified geometry of the actual bat, particularly the aluminum one, which may have tapers or fillets internally to reduce stress concentrations.

### ANSYS Simulation

Aside from the MATLAB FEM simulation, we also ran a ‚Äòtrue‚Äô FEM simulation using ANSYS Modal. We built a STEP model of the aluminum bat, which is neatly truncated at the clamping point, and then fix-supported it at that cross-section plane. We set the density of the aluminum bat exactly as our calculated number, and set the Young‚Äôs modulus to our resulting Young‚Äôs modulus from the MATLAB code, which could perfectly match the first mode frequency. The element size was 1mm, which was much finer than our MATLAB model.

![ansys freqs](@assets/images/bat-vibration/ansys-freqs.png)

By plotting the Total Deformation in ANSYS, we could see what these modes were. Since in ANSYS we did a 3D model instead of the 2D model in MATLAB, we got bending modes both in the X direction and the Z direction, which were certainly symmetrical (Mode 1 & 2, Mode 4 & 5 in the ANSYS results).
Aside from the bending modes and axial modes, we also got a hoop mode (Mode 3 in the ANSYS results) which features radial expansion and contraction. Such hoop modes do not exist in our 2D simulation, because we assumed that each x coordinate corresponds to only one transverse displacement v(x) (in a hoop mode this is obviously false).

After eliminating the hoop mode, we found that the 2 lowest modes (19.749 Hz and 242.9 Hz) for the aluminum bat were both bending modes, and the 3rd lowest mode (861.86 Hz) was an axial mode. The values of the first 2 natural frequencies were quite close to the result we got from MATLAB simulation (20.5 Hz and 255.6 Hz), which indicated that our MATLAB code did not have major errors.

## Conclusion

We successfully modeled the mechanical vibration behavior of both wooden and aluminum baseball bats using finite element analysis methods in MATLAB. By discretizing each bat into Euler-Bernoulli beam elements and solving the resulting eigenvalue problem, we estimated bending stiffness values (EI) that accurately reproduced the first natural frequency observed experimentally.

We also found that optimizing for the first mode alone provided the most reliable stiffness estimate due to the sensitivity of higher modes to boundary conditions. The resultant Young‚Äôs Modulus values - approximately 49.98 GPa for aluminum, 22.92 GPa for vertically struck wood, and 20.74 GPa for horizontally struck wood. These align reasonably with expected material properties, though slightly lower than textbook measurements, likely due to support compliances. The convergence test ensured a sufficient mesh density without excessive computation, and error analysis showed that while first-mode errors were negligible, second-mode predictions deviated more, suggesting the experimental setup was not a perfect fixed-free model. ANSYS simulations reinforced this hypothesis and validated our MATLAB model by showing good agreement for the first two bending modes when the same stiffness and densities were used.

Overall, we demonstrated the accuracy of vibration modeling in characterizing real world structures, and how analytical tools like FEM can be used to infer material properties and design insights from experimental data. We are confident that this methodology can be utilized across other engineering systems where vibrational behavior impacts performance.
