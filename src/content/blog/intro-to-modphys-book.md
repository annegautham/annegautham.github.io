Hi y'all!

I wrote and published a 100 page book "Introduction to Modern Physics", ISBN 979-8849892566, which is available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Physics-Gautham-Anne/dp/B0BD2XNX7J">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/introduction-to-modern-physics-gautham-anne/1142532018">Barnes & Nobles</a>, and other distributors.

  <strong>Warning:</strong> Donâ€™t use it for formal study! I wrote a list of better resources for further study in the book.

The book covers the subjects of Special Relativity, a brief intro to General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Particle Physics, and Astrophysics. It's free in the kindle edition, and $11.04 for the paperback. I tried to make it as engaging as possible, being narrated by a cat and dog, but there are definitely things I could work on. If I ever feel motivated enough to edit the book, I'd attempt to make it slightly more mathematical. While the goal was purely in garnering interest for the subject, I do feel a formal perspective is helpful for understanding.

Mu main reason for writing the book was to incentivize better note-taking in my "Modern Physics" class at IMSA. I was lucky enough to study these topics before college, and thought publishing a book would be a nice exercise on creativity.

Specifically, I chose the self--publishing route because it is the fastest way to get the book to market! The internet is riddled with resources to publish through Amazon's KDP, and it is a lot easier to work with than it sounds. Feel free to reach out if you have questions!

Here's some sample pages!
